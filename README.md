## Usage


To auto update the electron app Mac and Windows versions, the current build versions will need to be published in a Github Release. 

### Mac 

> A current packaged distribution version will need to be in a .zip and added to the release. 

### Windows 

> A current packaged distribution version will need to be in a .exe and added to the release. 

Title the release and add the new electron app version in the tag and publish the release. The new version will also need to be added to the S3 bucket to ensure that new downloads will be using the current version of the electron app.
